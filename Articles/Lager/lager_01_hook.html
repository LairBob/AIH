<p><em>“You keep saying that. I do not think that word means what you think it means.”          &mdash; Inigo Montoya</em></p>

<p>Believe it or not, “lager” is probably one of the most misunderstood (and misused) terms that we use when we talk about beer. Even if you think you know what it means, there’s a very good chance that you’re actually using the term incorrectly &mdash; and missing out on a technique that can improve <em>all</em> the beer you make. </p>

<p>In this article, we are going to start by exploring some of those misconceptions, but then we’re going to dive into exactly <a href="http://www.homebrewing.org/How-to-Lager_ep_57-1.html">how lagering works</a>, and <a href="http://www.homebrewing.org/Lagering--Chapter-3-Advanced-Tips_ep_59-1.html">how you can take advantage of it for yourself</a> to make great beer.</p>

<h2>Misconception #1:</br>“Lager” and “Ale” Have Opposite Meanings</h2>

<p>The original German word, <em>lagern</em>, only refers to the process of cold storage, and &mdash; contrary to common belief &mdash; you can productively “lager” any beer, even a standard ale. In fact, many breweries lager their beers, whether they’re making a pale ale or a pilsener.</p>

<h3>What does lagering do to a beer?</h3>
<p>A well-lagered beer is not only going to be clearer (and therefore cleaner-tasting). It’s also going to have a more developed set of flavors showing through. You know how if you savor a keg for a few weeks, that last beer looks and tastes so much better than the first one? That’s not just because you’re getting sentimental. It’s because you’ve basically been lagering the beer in your fridge the whole time &mdash; long enough to reap some of the benefits before it’s gone.</p>

<div class="sidebar">
	<p><strong>Try this at home:</strong> Go out and buy two six-packs of a good quality ale. Store one six pack somewhere relatively cool (around 60F), like your basement, where it’ll stay fresh for a while. Store the second six-pack somewhere much colder &mdash; as close as you can get to freezing, without quite getting there. (Probably the very back of your fridge.)</p> 
	<p>Leave both six-packs alone for a few weeks, and then do a taste comparison between the two. Odds are, you’ll be able to see and taste a real difference, with the advantage going to the cold-stored beer.</p>
</div>

<h3>How does lagering work?</h3>
<p>There are two important processes at work when a beer is in long-term cold-storage:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Precipitation:</em> Take a certain amount of liquid, warm it up, and you can obviously dissolve more solids into that same volume. Take that same warm liquid, and cool it down, and the amount of dissolved solids that it can contain will decrease. Those solids will “precipitate”, or re-solidify and fall to the bottom of your storage container. (The simplest version of this process is what we all know as “cold-crashing”.)</li>
		<li><em>Aging:</em> All the chemical reactions going on in your beer &mdash; good or bad &mdash; take place much more slowly in the cold. As it happens, though, most of the processes you don’t want are slowed down more. An extended period of cold storage builds up the benefits that you do want, with less of the effects that you don’t. (With some important exceptions: see the discussion of <a href="http://www.homebrewing.org/Lagering--Chapter-2-How-to-Lager_ep_57-1.html#lager-02-diacetyl">“Diacetyl Rest”</a>, in the next chapter.)</li>
	</ul>


<h2>Misconception #2:</br>“Lager” = “Bottom-fermentation”</h2>

<p>Lagers are typically defined as “bottom-fermented” beers. While this is usually true, it’s not <em>necessarily</em> true &mdash; cold storage was used to make beer for centuries before the cultivation of bottom-fermenting yeasts.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it was the tradition of cold-storage that led to bottom-fermenting &mdash; centuries of lagering brought about a new strain of yeast, one that thrives at colder temperatures (<em>“saccharomyces pastorianus”</em>). Since these yeasts obviously work much better cold, it’s only natural that the process and the product became so tightly linked.</p>

<p>Beyond a preference for colder temperature, lager yeasts are different from traditional “ale” yeasts in a few important ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><em>Bottom-fermentation:</em> Obviously, lager yeasts tend to concentrate at the bottom of the wort during fermentation, rather than the top. While this doesn’t have much practical significance, it does help make clear siphon transfers.</li> 
		<li><em>Higher attenuation:</em> Most lager yeasts are able to convert a broader range of sugars than the typical ale yeast, so they generally produce a clearer, less “fruity” beer, with a slightly higher alcohol content.</li>
		<li><em>Undesirable by-products:</em> Lager yeasts are also more liable to generate some unwanted compounds, especially sulfur and diacetyl. There are specific steps that can minimize these effects, though, which we will get into in the next section.</li>
	</ul>
<h2>Misconception #3: “Lager” = “Pilsener”</h2>

<p>Even though light-bodied and crisp styles &mdash; especially pilseners &mdash; have come to represent a “lager”, you don’t want to overlook a wide range of excellent, distinctive lager beers. The world of lager beers encompasses many of the very darkest styles that you can find, as well as clean, well-balanced ambers.</p>
