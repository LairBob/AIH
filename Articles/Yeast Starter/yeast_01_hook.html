<p>It may seem like a lot of extra time and effort to make a yeast starter. After all, people just pitch yeast straight from the tube or smack pack every day, right? Don't their beers turn out fine?</p>

<p>Well...yes and no. You certainly don't <em>have</em> to make a starter just to have a successful brew, but getting your yeast started ahead of time is actually a pretty simple way to reap a lot of great benefits. In this article, we'll take a look at the benefits of making a starter, take you through the steps of how to do it right, and then share a lot of practical tips from our team and the AIH community.</p>

<h2>How Starters Benefit Your Beer</h2>
<p>Using a yeast starter can immediately improve the results of your brewing process in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Accelerated Fermentation:</em> One of the most direct benefits of making a yeast starter comes from the fact that you're not only pitching <em>more</em> yeast, but you're pitching yeast that has already moved back into an active state. Your fermentation is going to get underway immediately, rather than 24-36 hours later. Sure, that should cut down on the time for your primary fermentation, but it also means that you're creating a sterile environment much more quickly, cutting down on the risk of infection, and the heavier CO2 it produces is more rapidly displacing oxygen in the headspace of your fermentation vessel, helping to limit the risk of haziness and off-flavors.</li>
	<li><em>Better Attenuation:</em> You're also much more likely to get to a lower final gravity, and quicker. You might think "The yeast is the yeast, and it's going to eat what it's what it's going to eat. Why would the final gravity be any different just because there was more of it?" The analogy we like to use is a car &mdash; it always weighs the same, but it's a lot easier to stop a car that's going 10mph, than one that's going 50mph. The volume of yeast in a vial or a smack-pack is carefully calibrated to go through primary fermentation over the course of several days, at which point most of it will have flocculated (depending on the strain). When you start with a large volume of active yeast, then by the time you're reaching the end of primary fermentation, you've got a lot more yeast that's still active and in suspension. That larger amount of active yeast can continue to process unconverted sugars before it has completely flocculated, so it only makes sense that it will do a more complete job of conversion.</li>
	<li><em>Clearer Beer:</em> One of the first things that we often hear back, after a customer makes their first starter, is "The beer was so clear!!" As you might guess, "better attenuation" = "clearer beer", since more of the fermentables have been converted to alcohol, but there's more to it than that. One of the most common factors that can lead to hazy beer is actually a slight level of infection, which can creep in at the very beginning of primary fermentation. </li>
</ul>

<h2>How a Yeast Starter Works</h2>
<p>To understand why a yeast starter can bring you all these benefits, it helps to understand the yeast fermentation cycle, and how making a starter affects it:</p>
