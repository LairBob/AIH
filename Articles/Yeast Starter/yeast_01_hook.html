<p>It may seem like a lot of extra time and effort to make a yeast starter. After all, people just pitch yeast straight from the tube or smack pack every day, right? Don't their beers turn out fine?</p>

<p>Well...yes and no. You certainly don't <em>have</em> to make a starter just to have a successful brew, but getting your yeast started ahead of time is actually a pretty simple way to reap a lot of great benefits. In this article, we'll take a look at the benefits of making a starter, take you through the steps of how to do it right, and then share a lot of practical tips from our team and the AIH community.</p>

<h2>How A Yeast Starter Benefits Your Beer</h2>
<p>Using a yeast starter can immediately improve the results of your brewing process in a few ways. Let's take a quick look at those benefits, and then we'll get more into the details of "why".</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>Accelerated Fermentation:</em> Your active fermentation is going to get underway within the first few hours after you pitch it, rather than 24-36 hours later. Not only does that cut down on the overall time for your primary, but it also means that you're much less likely to end up with a fermentation that gets "stuck" at some point along the way.</li>
	<li><em>Lower Risk of Infection:</em> Because you're creating a sterile environment much more quickly, cutting down on the chances of ending up with haziness, off-flavors or &mdash; worse yet &mdash; just a spoiled batch.</li>
	<li><em>Better Attenuation:</em> You're much more likely to get to a lower final gravity when you use a starter, compared to pitching without one. If your FG is consistently a little high, one of the first things you should try is switching to making a starter.</li>
	<li><em>Clearer Beer:</em> One of the things that we often hear, after a customer makes their first starter, is "The beer was so clear!!" As you might guess, "better attenuation" = "clearer beer", but there are actually several reasons that a starter can lead to a clearer final product.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How a Yeast Starter Works</h2>
<p>To understand why a yeast starter can bring you all these benefits, it helps to understand the cycle that yeast goes through once you pitch it, and how that cycle is changed when you make a starter:</p>
<h3>Lag Phase: Waking with a Jump Start</h3>
<p>Dormant yeast cells carry internal stores of a carbohydrate called <em>glycogen</em>. When the dormant yeast are exposed to the oxygen and nitrogen in your wort, they quickly start metabolizing that stored glycogen into glucose. That jolt of energy they produce in this "Lag" phase jump-starts their cellular metabolism, and allows them to begin reproduction. This is when your wort is actually most susceptible to contamination, since it is not yet an environment that is hostile to unwanted bacteria. A slight infection that takes place at this point won't necessarily ruin your beer, but even when you can't taste them, low levels of infection are actually a common cause of cloudiness and hazing.</p>
<h3>Growth Phase: Explosive Reproduction</h3>
<p>In the "Growth" phase, the yeast continue to consume oxygen and nitrogen from the wort, and use it to fuel a huge rate of reproduction &mdash; the population of yeast cells will often double or triple in the first 24-48 hours. One of the unavoidable by-products generated during this aerobic process is <em>diacetyl</em>, which would give your beer a butterscotch-y flavor if it ends up in your final product, and which you usually want to avoid. The yeast will actually re-metabolize that diacetyl once they've used up all the oxygen, and can move into the fermentation phase, but that means you want to move through the "Growth" phase as quickly as possible.</p>
